1. Define the data structure:

-> Identify the data entities, such as user profiles, posts, comments, likes, etc.

-> Determine the properties or attributes for each entity. For example, a user entity might have properties like name, profile picture, email, and bio, while a post entity might have properties like content, image, timestamp, and user ID.

-> Consider the relationships between entities. For instance, a post may be associated with a user through their ID, and comments may be related to posts.


2. Project Structure.
