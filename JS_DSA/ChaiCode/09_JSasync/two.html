<!-- In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects. This means they can be assigned to variables, stored in data structures, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as values from other functions.

When you refer to a function without parentheses, like sayHi, you're referencing the function object. You're not calling or invoking the function; you're just pointing to the function itself. This is useful when you want to pass the function as an argument to another function, like setTimeout.

When you add parentheses after the function name, like sayHi(), you're invoking or calling the function. This tells JavaScript to execute the function right now and return its result.

In the context of setTimeout, you want to pass a reference to a function (sayHi), not the result of a function (sayHi()). setTimeout will then call this function after the specified delay. If you pass sayHi(), the function gets called immediately, and setTimeout receives its result, not the function itself.   -->
