// The JavaScript Call Stack is a mechanism that interprets and executes a script. It's a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).

// Here's a simple example of how the call stack works:

function firstFunction() {
        throw new Error('Stack Trace Error');
}

function secondFunction() {
        firstFunction();
}

function thirdFunction() {
        secondFunction();
}

thirdFunction();

// When this code is run, the JavaScript engine creates a 'stack frame' for each function call:

// thirdFunction() gets added to the call stack.
// thirdFunction() calls secondFunction(), which is added to the top of the call stack.
// secondFunction() calls firstFunction(), which is added to the top of the call stack.
// firstFunction() throws an error, which includes the call stack trace.
// The error's stack trace shows that firstFunction() is on top (it was the last function entered), followed by secondFunction(), and then thirdFunction().

// The call stack is single-threaded, meaning it can only do one thing at a time. It's part of the JavaScript runtime environment, along with the Web APIs provided by the browser (like the DOM, AJAX, and setTimeout) and the Event Queue.
